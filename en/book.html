           <p>Throughout the 20th century, Japan was the world leader in manga creation. In fact, Japan accounts for almost half of all volumes of manga published worldwide. During this period, Japanese manga gained international popularity through comics, novels and films. As a result, many Japanese now live abroad and work in creative industries related to manga. In particular, the manga focuses on themes relevant to society such as love, family, freedom and friendship. As an art form, manga has many qualities that make it unique in literature.</p>

            <h3>lifetime's work</h3>
            <p>
                The manga contains elements of several genres such as adventure, action, drama, horror and more. The plot is essential to create a memorable work of fiction. A intrigue strong of discoveries, of rebound staging a bunch of character is what is One Piece. 
                The main characteristic that animates the story of One Piece is the character of Luffy. The author Eiichiro Oda founds his story through his main character who is unifying to talk about themes that are important to him such as slavery, geopolitics or racism. It is precisely a great strength of the author to be able to talk about this kind of thing in a manga released to the child at the base. 
                Another strength of the manga is its multitude of characters from a distant horizon and with each their story indeed each reader can identify with a character. What makes it with over 1000 characters appearing a complete universe is never seen in the history of Japanese comics.
